# Individual-Project
My 3rd Year Project

The main objective of this project was to find a method for orbit determination that would be feasible for the student led projects. The available measurements were too short arc angles only measurements. A secondary objective was to lay the groundwork on which to build a more robust object detection and orbit determination program. The program should be able to detect moving objects based on data from optical measurements, track them and thus estimate the object's orbit.

This repository contains all the pieces of code developed during the project.
